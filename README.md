# UnityPackageManager
Based on the project requirement, we need to understand the usage of the Unity Editor, where we can add some features that help developers simplify work. 

Feature:
-> Drag-Drop asset into the Dropzone. (easy to add multiple assets at a time.)
-> Remove Individual or multiple objects at a time.
-> Scene Folder Selection. (Multiple Scene Management.)
-> Use multiple types of assets. (Sprite, Scripts, Audio.)
-> Progression Bar Window.
-> Result Window.

 Working:
. Produce results based on Asset names will be varify with scene-attached objects.

You can find the first feature in this repo. [AssetUsageChecker]

AssetUsageChecker you can find in the Tool Tab.[in Unity Editor]
